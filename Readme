- A development environment with Solidity compiler (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat)
- An Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for sending transactions

### Deployment

1. Deploy the `MyToken` contract to an Ethereum blockchain using your preferred development environment.

2. After deployment, you can interact with the contract through its functions.

### Minting Tokens

To mint new tokens and add them to the total supply:
